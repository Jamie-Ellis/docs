## How It Works

### Message Flow

```
Client sends WhatsApp → WhatsApp Business API → Webhook → Juryo
                                                    ↓
                                          Contact Created/Found
                                                    ↓
                                          Message Stored & Displayed
                                                    ↓
Attorney replies in Juryo → WhatsApp API → Client receives message
```

### Automatic Contact Creation

When someone messages your WhatsApp Business number:

1. **Webhook received** from WhatsApp API
2. **System searches** for existing contact by phone number
3. **If not found**, creates new contact with:
   - Name: From WhatsApp profile (if available)
   - Phone: Sender's number
   - Source: "whatsapp"
4. **Message linked** to contact's communication history
5. **Appears in WhatsApp Inbox** for team to respond

### Conversation Threading

All messages between a contact and your firm are grouped into conversations:

- **Conversation ID**: Unique per phone number
- **Message History**: Complete thread visible in inbox
- **Timestamps**: All messages timestamped
- **Direction**: Inbound (from client) or Outbound (from team)

## Features

### WhatsApp Inbox

Real-time inbox for all WhatsApp conversations:

**Conversation List:**
- Contact name and phone number
- Last message preview
- Unread message count
- Last message timestamp
- Assigned team member

**Message Thread:**
- Full conversation history
- Message bubbles (inbound/outbound styling)
- Delivery status indicators
- Timestamp for each message
- Contact profile sidebar

### 24-Hour Messaging Window

WhatsApp enforces a 24-hour window for free-form messages:

**Within 24 Hours:**
- Send any message freely
- No restrictions on content

**After 24 Hours:**
- Must use approved message templates
- Template selector appears in UI
- Limited to pre-approved formats

**Juryo Handles This:**
- Automatically detects 24-hour window expiry
- Shows template selector when outside window
- Prevents sending free-form messages that will fail

### Message Templates

Pre-approved message formats for use outside the 24-hour window:

**Template Components:**
- Header (optional)
- Body (required, with variable placeholders)
- Footer (optional)
- Buttons (optional)

**Example Template:**
```
Name: appointment_reminder
Body: "Hi {{1}}, this is a reminder about your consultation on {{2}} at {{3}}. Reply CONFIRM to confirm."
Variables: [name, date, time]
```

**In Juryo:**
1. Select template from dropdown
2. Fill in variable values
3. Preview message
4. Send

### Team Assignment

Assign conversations to specific team members:

**Benefits:**
- Clear ownership of client conversations
- Filtered inbox views (My Conversations)
- Notification routing
- Workload distribution

**Assignment Methods:**
- Manual assignment
- Auto-assignment rules
- Round-robin distribution
- Expertise-based routing

## Integration Requirements

### WhatsApp Business API Account

**Required:**
- Meta Business Suite account
- WhatsApp Business API access (not WhatsApp Business App)
- Verified business

**Setup Steps:**

2. Verify business with Meta
3. Get phone number approved
4. Generate access token
5. Configure webhook URL

### Webhook Configuration

Juryo needs to receive webhooks from WhatsApp:

**Webhook URL:**
```
https://your-tenant.juryo.ai/api/webhook/whatsapp
```

**Webhook Events:**
- `messages` - Incoming messages
- `message_status` - Delivery/read receipts

WhatsApp will send verification request to confirm webhook ownership.

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Respond promptly within 24-hour window">
    **Why:** Free-form responses only available for 24 hours. After that, limited to templates.

    **How:** Set up notifications for new WhatsApp messages. Aim to respond within a few hours.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use professional, concise language">
    **Why:** WhatsApp is informal but still represents your firm.

    **How:** Be friendly but professional. Use proper grammar. Keep messages concise.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Create templates for common scenarios">
    **Why:** Templates allow communication outside 24-hour window.

    **Common Templates:**
    - Appointment reminders
    - Document requests
    - Status updates
    - Follow-up messages
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Assign conversations to appropriate team members">
    **Why:** Ensures client gets help from the right person. Prevents duplicate responses.

    **How:** Auto-assign based on legal area or round-robin. Manually reassign as needed.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Link conversations to opportunities/cases">
    **Why:** Provides context for team members. Tracks conversation outcome.

    **How:** Conversations auto-link to contacts. Manually link to specific opportunities or cases if needed.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Limitations & Considerations

### WhatsApp Business API Restrictions

- **Phone Number**: Must be dedicated to API (can't use same number for WhatsApp Business App)
- **Templates**: Require Meta approval (can take 24-48 hours)
- **Pricing**: WhatsApp charges per conversation (free tier available)
- **24-Hour Window**: Strict enforcement of messaging window rules

### Juryo Implementation

- **No Multimedia (Yet)**: Current implementation is text-only. Images/files coming soon.
- **Template Management**: Templates managed in Meta Business Suite, not Juryo
- **Message Deletion**: Cannot delete sent messages (WhatsApp limitation)
- **Group Chats**: Not supported. One-on-one conversations only.
