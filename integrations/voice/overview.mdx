</Info>

## How It Works

### Call Flow

```
Client calls → Retell AI Agent → Conversation happens
                       ↓
               AI analyzes call
                       ↓
          Webhook sent to Juryo
                       ↓
        Contact created/found
                       ↓
   Opportunity created (if qualified)
                       ↓
    Communication logged with transcript
```

### Agent-to-Tenant Mapping

Each Retell AI agent is mapped to a specific Juryo tenant:

**Configuration in Juryo:**
```
Agent ID: agent_123abc
→ Tenant: saldados-law-firm
→ Legal Area: Immigration
```

**When call received:**
1. Webhook includes agent ID
2. Juryo looks up tenant mapping
3. Contact/opportunity created in correct tenant
4. Scoped properly for data isolation

See [Agent Mapping](/integrations/voice/agent-mapping) for configuration.

## Features

### Automatic Call Handling

Retell AI agents can:
- **Answer calls** immediately (no wait time)
- **Collect information**: Name, phone, reason for calling
- **Answer FAQs**: Pre-programmed responses to common questions
- **Qualify leads**: Determine if caller is good fit
- **Schedule appointments**: Integration with calendar (if configured)
- **Transfer calls**: Route to human if needed

### Conversation Intelligence

Every call is analyzed for:

**Qualification Criteria:**
- Did conversation succeed?
- First filter passed (basic qualification)?
- Fully qualified lead?
- Appointment status (booked, declined, pending)

**Extracted Information:**
- Caller name and phone
- Legal area of interest
- Urgency level
- Budget indication (if discussed)
- Follow-up requirements

**Sentiment Analysis:**
- Caller emotion (positive, neutral, negative)
- Confidence level in proceeding
- Objection handling success

### Automatic Opportunity Creation

If call is qualified, Juryo automatically creates:

1. **Contact** (if doesn't exist)
   - Name from conversation
   - Phone number
   - Source: "retell_call"

2. **Opportunity**
   - Title: Based on legal need
   - Stage: "Contacted" (already spoke)
   - Service Type: From conversation analysis
   - Priority: Based on urgency

3. **Communication Record**
   - Type: "retell_call"
   - Full transcript
   - Analysis results
   - Call duration
   - Success indicators

### Call Transcripts

Complete transcripts stored for every call:

**Transcript Format:**
```
[00:00:03] Agent: Hello, thank you for calling. How can I help you today?
[00:00:08] Caller: Hi, I need help with a work visa application.
[00:00:12] Agent: I'd be happy to help with that. Can I get your name?
[00:00:15] Caller: Sure, it's Maria Rodriguez.
[00:00:18] Agent: Thank you Maria. And your phone number?
[00:00:22] Caller: It's 555-123-4567.
...
```

**Access Transcripts:**
- Call Log page in Juryo
- Individual call detail view
- Communication tab on contact/opportunity
- Via API: GET /api/retell-calls/:id

### Integration with Zapier

For failed or unqualified calls, send to Zapier:

**Trigger:** Call ends with status "not qualified" or "no answer"

**Zapier Action Options:**
- Send notification to Slack
- Create task in project management tool
- Add to CRM for manual follow-up
- Send email alert to team

**Webhook Payload:**
```json
{
  "callId": "call_abc123",
  "status": "not_qualified",
  "phone": "+15551234567",
  "reason": "Budget too low",
  "transcript": "...",
  "duration": 120
}
```

## Voice Agent API

Special endpoints for Retell AI agents to query during live calls:

### GET /api/voice/cases

Agent can ask: "What cases does this client have?"

**Response:** List of cases for the phone number calling

**Use Case:** Agent can provide case status updates during call

### POST /api/voice/clients

Create contact from voice interaction:

**Request:**
```json
{
  "phone": "+15551234567",
  "firstName": "Maria",
  "lastName": "Rodriguez",
  "agentId": "agent_123abc"
}
```

**Use Case:** Agent creates contact mid-call for follow-up

### POST /api/voice/client-with-case

Create both contact and case in one call:

**Use Case:** Qualified caller wants to proceed immediately. Agent creates contact, opportunity, and initiates case.

See [Voice Agent API](/api-reference/voice/overview) for complete documentation.

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Train agents for your practice area">
    **Why:** Generic agents won't understand legal terminology or processes.

    **How:** Customize agent prompts with your firm's specific services, FAQs, and qualification criteria.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Set clear qualification criteria">
    **Why:** Not every caller is a good fit. Agent should qualify effectively.

    **Criteria to configure:**
    - Budget range
    - Timeline urgency
    - Legal need fit
    - Geographic location (if relevant)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Review call transcripts regularly">
    **Why:** Identify areas for agent improvement and training opportunities.

    **How:** Weekly review of 10-20 random calls. Note patterns, objections, confusion points.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Set up fallback to human">
    **Why:** Complex situations require human touch.

    **When:** Agent confused, caller frustrated, high-value opportunity, technical legal questions.
  </Accordion>
