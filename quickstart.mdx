## Welcome to Juryo

This guide will walk you through the essential workflow in Juryo: from capturing a lead to managing a case. By the end, you'll understand how to use the core features of the platform.

<Info>
**Prerequisites**

- Active Juryo account with login credentials
- Admin or Lawyer role (Client role has limited access)
- Your law firm's tenant is configured
</Info>

## Step 1: Log In to Your Tenant

Juryo uses domain-based routing to identify your law firm.

1. Navigate to your tenant's URL (e.g., `https://yourlawfirm.juryo.ai`)
2. Click **Sign In** and authenticate via Replit Auth
3. You'll be redirected to the Dashboard

<Note>
Each law firm has its own isolated tenant with complete data separation. You can only access your firm's data.
</Note>

## Step 2: Create Your First Contact

Contacts are the foundation of Juryo - they represent people in various stages of the client lifecycle.

### From the Dashboard

1. Navigate to **Clients** in the sidebar
2. Click **New Contact** button
3. Fill in the contact details:
   - **Name**: First and last name

</Tip>

### Contact Lifecycle Stages

Contacts move through these stages:

- **Prospect** - Qualified and engaged
- **Qualified Lead** - Ready for consultation
- **Client** - Actively working with your firm
- **Former Client** - Past client relationship

## Step 3: Create an Opportunity

Opportunities represent potential cases in your sales pipeline. They help you track leads from first contact to case conversion.

### From a Contact's Profile

1. Open the contact you just created
2. Click **Create Opportunity**
3. Fill in the opportunity details:
   - **Title**: Brief description (e.g., "Work Visa Application")
   - **Stage**: Current pipeline stage (default: "Lead")
   - **Service Type**: Legal service category (Immigration, Business Law, etc.)
   - **Legal Process**: Specific procedure (e.g., "H-1B Visa", "Green Card")
   - **Estimated Value**: Expected revenue
   - **Priority**: High, Medium, or Low
   - **Expected Close Date**: When you expect to close the deal

4. Click **Create Opportunity**

### The 7-Stage Pipeline

Opportunities progress through these stages:

1. **Lead** - Initial inquiry
2. **Contacted** - First touchpoint made
3. **Qualified** - Fit confirmed
4. **Appointment Booked** - Consultation scheduled
5. **Proposal Sent** - Service agreement sent
6. **Won** - Client signed, ready to convert to case
7. **Lost** - Opportunity didn't convert

<Tip>
Use the **Opportunities** page to view your pipeline in a Kanban board. Drag and drop opportunities between stages.
