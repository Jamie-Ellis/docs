## The 7-Stage Pipeline

Opportunities progress through seven distinct stages from initial inquiry to conversion or loss.

### Pipeline Stages

| Stage | Description | Key Activities | Success Criteria |
|-------|-------------|----------------|------------------|
| **1. Lead** | Initial inquiry received | Capture contact information, identify need | Contact information collected |
| **2. Contacted** | First touchpoint made | Initial call/email, understand situation | Two-way communication established |
| **3. Qualified** | Fit confirmed | Budget discussion, timeline confirmed, legal need validated | Qualified as viable opportunity |
| **4. Appointment Booked** | Consultation scheduled | Calendar invite sent, reminder scheduled | Meeting on calendar |
| **5. Proposal Sent** | Service agreement delivered | Proposal/contract sent, terms explained | Client reviewing proposal |
| **6. Won** | Client signed | Agreement executed, ready to begin work | Convert to case |
| **7. Lost** | Did not convert | Document reason, schedule follow-up (optional) | Opportunity closed |

### Stage Progression

```
Lead → Contacted → Qualified → Appointment Booked → Proposal Sent → Won
                                                                       ↓
                                                                     Case

                                    Lost ← (Can exit at any stage)
```

**Typical Conversion Rates:**
- Lead → Contacted: 80-90%
- Contacted → Qualified: 50-60%
- Qualified → Appointment Booked: 70-80%
- Appointment Booked → Proposal Sent: 85-95%
- Proposal Sent → Won: 40-60%

**Overall Lead → Won:** ~20-30% (industry average)

## Creating Opportunities

### Manual Creation

#### From Contact Record

1. Open a contact's profile
2. Click **Create Opportunity**
3. Fill in opportunity details:
   - **Title**: Descriptive name (e.g., "H-1B Visa Application")
   - **Stage**: Starting stage (usually "Lead")
   - **Service Type**: Category of legal service
   - **Legal Process**: Specific procedure
   - **Estimated Value**: Expected revenue
   - **Probability**: Likelihood of winning (0-100%)
   - **Priority**: High, Medium, Low
   - **Expected Close Date**: Target conversion date
4. Click **Create Opportunity**

#### From Opportunities Page

1. Navigate to **Opportunities**
2. Click **New Opportunity**
3. Select or create contact
4. Fill in opportunity details
5. Click **Create**

### Automatic Creation

Opportunities can be created automatically from various sources:

#### 1. Voice Call Analysis

When Retell AI analyzes a call and detects opportunity potential:

```javascript
// Retell webhook creates opportunity automatically
{
  "contactPhone": "+1234567890",
  "callAnalysis": {
    "qualified": true,
    "legalArea": "Immigration",
    "urgency": "high"
  }
}

// Result: Opportunity created with stage "Contacted"
// Service type set based on conversation analysis
```

**Configuration:**
- Retell AI agent trained to identify legal needs
- Qualification criteria configured
- See [Voice Integration](/integrations/voice/overview)

#### 2. WhatsApp Conversations

When WhatsApp analysis indicates opportunity:

```
User: "I need help with my work visa application"
→ System analyzes message
→ Creates contact if not exists
→ Creates opportunity with stage "Lead"
→ Links WhatsApp conversation to opportunity
```

#### 3. External Webhooks

Website forms or CRM systems can create opportunities:

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://api.juryo.ai/api/webhook/contact-opportunity' \
  -H 'x-tenant-id: your-tenant-uuid' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "contact": {
      "firstName": "Maria",
      "lastName": "Rodriguez",
      "email": "maria@example.com",
      "phone": "+1234567890"
    },
    "opportunity": {
      "title": "Green Card Application",
      "serviceType": "Immigration",
      "legalProcess": "EB-2 Green Card",
      "stage": "lead",
      "estimatedValue": 15000,
      "priority": "high",
      "source": "website"
    }
  }'
```

See [Webhook Integration](/integrations/webhooks/configuration) for setup.

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Update opportunities regularly">
    **Why:** Stale pipeline data leads to inaccurate forecasts and missed opportunities.

    **How:** Review pipeline weekly. Update stages promptly. Set automation reminders for inactive opportunities.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Track all touchpoints">
    **Why:** Complete communication history improves conversion rates and provides valuable insights.

    **How:** Use WhatsApp/voice integrations for automatic logging. Manually log email and in-person meetings.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use accurate estimated values">
    **Why:** Revenue forecasts depend on realistic value estimates. Inflated values create false expectations.

    **How:** Base estimates on standard fee schedules. Update values as scope becomes clearer.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Adjust probabilities by stage">
    **Why:** Not all "Proposal Sent" opportunities have 80% probability. Adjust based on specific circumstances.

    **How:** Consider client responsiveness, budget fit, competition, urgency when setting probability.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Document loss reasons">
    **Why:** Understanding why you lose helps improve processes and qualify better.

    **How:** Always select loss reason and add notes. Review quarterly to identify patterns.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Set realistic close dates">
    **Why:** Overdue opportunities clutter pipeline and reduce forecast accuracy.

    **How:** Base close dates on average cycle time for similar opportunities. Update as circumstances change.
