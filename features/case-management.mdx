## Case Lifecycle

Cases progress through customizable statuses as legal work advances.

### Standard Status Flow

| Status | Description | Typical Duration |
|--------|-------------|------------------|
| **Consultation** | Initial case review and assessment | 1-7 days |
| **Active** | Work in progress | Varies by case type |
| **Waiting on Client** | Awaiting client documents or payment | Variable |
| **Waiting on Third Party** | Pending external responses (USCIS, courts, etc.) | Variable |
| **Under Review** | Internal review before submission | 3-7 days |
| **Submitted** | Filed with agency or court | Variable |
| **Completed** | Case successfully closed | N/A |
| **Cancelled** | Case terminated before completion | N/A |

<Note>
Case statuses are customizable per tenant. Admins can configure workflows specific to their practice areas.

## Creating Cases

### From Won Opportunity

The most common way to create a case is by converting a won opportunity:

1. Open the opportunity (must be in "Won" stage)
2. Click **Convert to Case**
3. System pre-fills information:
   - **Client**: Opportunity's contact (automatically updated to "Client" role)
   - **Legal Area**: From opportunity service type
   - **Legal Process**: From opportunity details
   - **Case Value**: From opportunity estimated value
4. Add case-specific details:
   - Case name/number (auto-generated or custom)
   - Assigned attorney
   - Initial status (typically "Consultation")
   - Expected completion date
   - Case notes
5. Click **Create Case**

**Automatic Actions:**
- Contact role updated to "Client"
- Opportunity linked to case
- Communication history transferred
- Document requirements populated (based on legal process)
- Initial tasks created (if workflow configured)

### Manual Case Creation

Create a case directly without an opportunity:

1. Navigate to **Cases** page
2. Click **New Case**
3. Select or create client contact
4. Fill in case details:
   - **Case Name**: Descriptive title
   - **Legal Area**: Practice area (Immigration, Corporate, Family, etc.)
   - **Legal Process**: Specific procedure (H-1B Visa, LLC Formation, etc.)
   - **Assigned Attorney**: Primary team member
   - **Status**: Initial status
   - **Priority**: High, Medium, Low
   - **Fee Structure**: Flat fee, hourly, contingency
   - **Case Value**: Expected revenue
5. Click **Create Case**

### API Case Creation

```javascript
const response = await fetch('/api/cases', {
  method: 'POST',
  credentials: 'include',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    clientId: "contact-uuid",
    caseName: "H-1B Visa - Software Engineer",
    legalAreaId: "immigration-uuid",
    legalProcessId: "h1b-visa-uuid",
    assignedAttorneyId: "attorney-uuid",
    status: "consultation",
    priority: "high",
    estimatedValue: 8000,
    notes: "Initial consultation scheduled for Jan 15"
  })
});

const { data } = await response.json();
console.log('Case created:', data.id);
```
