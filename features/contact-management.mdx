## Overview

Juryo's contact management system provides a unified approach to tracking people throughout their entire relationship with your law firm. Instead of maintaining separate "leads" and "clients" databases, Juryo uses a single **Contact** entity that evolves through lifecycle stages.

<Info>
**Key Benefits**
- Single source of truth for all contact information
- Complete interaction history in one place
- Seamless transition from lead to client
- Automatic contact creation from WhatsApp and voice calls
</Info>

## Contact Lifecycle

Contacts progress through five distinct stages as their relationship with your firm develops.

### Stage Definitions

| Stage | Description | Typical Activities |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Lead** | Initial contact, not yet qualified | First inquiry, form submission, cold outreach |
| **Prospect** | Qualified and showing interest | Initial consultation scheduled, budget discussed |
| **Qualified Lead** | Ready for formal engagement | Proposal sent, service agreement in review |
| **Client** | Actively working with your firm | Case in progress, regular communication |
| **Former Client** | Past client relationship | Case completed, relationship concluded |

### Stage Progression

Contacts typically move forward through stages, but can also move backward:

```
Lead → Prospect → Qualified Lead → Client → Former Client
  ↑        ↓           ↓            ↓
  └────────┴───────────┴────────────┘
    (Can move backward if circumstances change)
```

**Automatic Stage Progression:**
- Converting an opportunity to a case automatically updates contact to "Client"
- Closing a case can optionally update contact to "Former Client"
- Communication analysis can trigger stage advancement

**Manual Stage Management:**
- Lawyers can manually update contact stages at any time
- Stage changes are logged in the activity history
- Automation rules can trigger actions on stage changes

## Contact Fields & Data

### Core Information

**Basic Details:**
- First Name and Last Name (required)
- Email address
- Phone number (with country code)
- Physical address
- Notes/description

**Lifecycle Tracking:**
- Current role (lead, prospect, qualified_lead, client, former_client)
- Acquisition source (website, referral, whatsapp, retell_call, other)
- Acquisition channel (specific campaign or medium)
- First contact date
- Last contact date

**External Integration:**
- External ID (for syncing with CRM or other systems)
- Unique constraint per tenant: `(tenantId, externalID)`

### Role History

Juryo maintains a complete history of role changes in the `contact_roles` table:

```typescript
{
  contactId: "uuid",
  role: "client",
  startDate: "2025-01-01",
  endDate: null,  // null = current role
  isActive: true,
  notes: "Converted from qualified lead after signing agreement"
}
```

**Use Cases:**
- Track how long contacts spend in each stage
- Analyze conversion patterns
- Generate reports on lifecycle progression
- Audit trail for compliance

## Creating Contacts

### Manual Creation

#### Via Web Interface

1. Navigate to **Clients** page
2. Click **New Contact** button
3. Fill in required fields:
   - Name
   - Email or Phone (at least one required)
   - Source (how they found you)
4. Optional fields:
   - Address
   - Channel details
   - Initial notes
5. Click **Create Contact**

#### Via API

```javascript
const response = await fetch('/api/contacts', {
  method: 'POST',
  credentials: 'include',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    firstName: "Maria",
    lastName: "Garcia",
    email: "maria.garcia@example.com",
    phone: "+1234567890",
    acquisitionSource: "website",
    acquisitionChannel: "contact-form",
    notes: "Interested in H-1B visa services"
  })
});

const { data } = await response.json();
console.log('Contact created:', data.id);
```

See [Create Contact API](/api-reference/contacts/create-contact) for full documentation.

### Automatic Contact Creation

Contacts are automatically created from multiple channels:

#### 1. WhatsApp Messages

When someone messages your WhatsApp Business number:
- System checks if contact exists by phone number
- If not found, creates new contact with source "whatsapp"
- Links message to contact's communication history
- Contact appears in Clients list immediately

**Configuration:**
- Requires WhatsApp Business API integration
- Phone number mapping to tenant
- See [WhatsApp Setup](/integrations/whatsapp/setup)

#### 2. Retell AI Voice Calls

When Retell AI receives a call:
- Voice agent collects caller information
- System searches for existing contact by phone
- Creates contact if not found, with source "retell_call"
- Attaches call transcript and analysis
- Can automatically create opportunity based on conversation

**Configuration:**
- Requires Retell AI agent mapping to tenant
- Voice agent configured to collect contact info
- See [Voice Integration](/integrations/voice/overview)

#### 3. Webhook Integrations

External systems can create contacts via webhook:

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://api.juryo.ai/api/webhook/contact-opportunity' \
  -H 'x-tenant-id: your-tenant-uuid' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "contact": {
      "firstName": "John",
      "lastName": "Smith",
      "email": "john@example.com",
      "phone": "+1234567890",
      "acquisitionSource": "website"
    },
    "opportunity": {
      "title": "Immigration Consultation",
      "serviceType": "Immigration",
      "stage": "lead"
    }
  }'
```

**Use Cases:**
- Website contact forms
- Landing page submissions
- CRM integrations
- Marketing automation systems
- Zapier workflows

See [Webhook Integration](/integrations/webhooks/overview) for setup.

## External System Integration

### CRM Sync

Keep Juryo contacts in sync with external CRMs:

**Using External IDs:**
```javascript
// Create contact with CRM reference
await fetch('/api/contacts', {
  method: 'POST',
  credentials: 'include',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    firstName: "John",
    lastName: "Doe",
    email: "john@example.com",
    externalID: "salesforce-12345"  // Your CRM's ID
  })
});

// Later, query by external ID
const response = await fetch(
  '/api/webhook/contacts?externalID=salesforce-12345',
  { headers: { 'x-tenant-id': 'your-tenant-id' } }
);
```

**Benefits:**
- Bidirectional sync with CRMs
- Avoid duplicate records
- Maintain single source of truth
- Track cross-system relationships

### Marketing Automation

Trigger marketing campaigns based on contact activity:

**Integration Options:**
- Zapier webhook triggers
- Direct API webhooks to marketing platforms
- Email marketing system sync
- SMS campaign triggers

**Example Integration:**
```
Contact Stage: Prospect → Qualified Lead
→ Webhook to Mailchimp
→ Add to "Qualified Leads" segment
→ Start drip email campaign
```

## Data Import & Export

### Bulk Import

Import contacts from CSV:

1. Prepare CSV file with columns:
   - firstName, lastName, email, phone
   - acquisitionSource, acquisitionChannel
   - notes (optional)

2. Use API to import:
```javascript
const contacts = csvData.map(row => ({
  firstName: row.firstName,
  lastName: row.lastName,
  email: row.email,
  phone: row.phone,
  acquisitionSource: "import",
  externalID: row.oldSystemId  // Preserve old IDs
}));

for (const contact of contacts) {
  await fetch('/api/contacts', {
    method: 'POST',
    credentials: 'include',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify(contact)
  });
}
```

### Export Contacts

Export contact data for analysis or backup:

```javascript
// Get all contacts
const response = await fetch('/api/contacts?limit=1000', {
  credentials: 'include'
});
const { data } = await response.json();

// Convert to CSV
const csv = convertToCSV(data);
downloadFile('contacts-export.csv', csv);
```

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Always capture acquisition source">
    **Why:** Knowing where contacts come from helps optimize marketing spend and understand what channels work best.

    **How:** Set up tracking parameters on website forms, use UTM parameters, configure source tracking in integrations.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Assign contacts immediately">
    **Why:** Unassigned contacts often fall through the cracks. Clear ownership ensures follow-up.

    **How:** Use automation rules to assign based on legal area, round-robin distribution, or workload balancing.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Keep contact information up to date">
    **Why:** Outdated email or phone numbers lead to failed communications and lost opportunities.

    **How:** Encourage team to update contact info during every interaction. Set up periodic data hygiene reviews.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use external IDs for CRM integration">
    **Why:** Prevents duplicate contacts when syncing with other systems. Enables bidirectional updates.

    **How:** Always include externalID when creating contacts from external sources. Use unique constraint to prevent duplicates.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Log all communications">
    **Why:** Complete communication history improves client service and provides legal documentation.

    **How:** Use WhatsApp/voice integrations for automatic logging. Train team to manually log calls and emails.
