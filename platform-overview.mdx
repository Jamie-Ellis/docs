### 5. Automation & Workflows

#### Automation Rules Engine

Create conditional automation based on triggers:

**Trigger Types:**
- **Opportunity Stage Change** - e.g., When opportunity moves to "Won"
- **Payment Status Update** - e.g., When payment becomes overdue
- **Scheduled Time** - e.g., Every Monday at 9am
- **Case Status Change** - e.g., When case completes
- **Communication Event** - e.g., After WhatsApp message received

**Actions:**
- Create tasks for team members
- Send webhooks to external systems
- Update entity fields
- Trigger additional flows
- Send notifications

**Example Automation:**
```
Trigger: Opportunity reaches "Won" stage
Conditions: Service type is "Immigration"
Actions:
  1. Create case with immigration legal process
  2. Send Slack notification to immigration team
  3. Create task "Schedule initial consultation"
  4. Send webhook to CRM with updated status
```

#### Task Management

**Scheduled Tasks:**
- Automated follow-ups with contacts
- Reminder tasks for deadlines
- Recurring check-ins
- Document collection reminders

**Task Execution:**

Learn more: [Webhook System](/integrations/webhooks/overview)

## Multi-Tenant Architecture

### Complete Data Isolation

Every law firm (tenant) has completely isolated data:
- **Separate database records** - All tables include `tenantId` foreign key
- **Domain-based routing** - Each firm has custom subdomain (e.g., `saldados.juryo.ai`)
- **Isolated file storage** - Google Cloud Storage with tenant-prefixed paths
- **Independent configurations** - Legal areas, processes, and workflows per tenant

### Tenant Resolution

Juryo identifies the tenant from:
1. **Domain name** - Subdomain mapping in `tenant_domains` table
2. **User association** - Current user's tenant membership
3. **Header override** - `x-tenant-id` header for webhooks and API calls
